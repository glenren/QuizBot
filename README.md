# QuizBot
This is a discord quizzing bot, currently with two commands:

- !make : Create your own question to add to the bot's question list

- !quiz : Take a quiz of 5 random questions pulled from the bot's question list, and get given a score

Currently working towards properly implementing:
- a choice of how many questions at the beginning of each quiz
- multiple choice questions
- sorting questions into categories for specified quizzing
